Project Title

Secure Role-Based File Sharing System

Domain

Cybersecurity

Abstract

In many organizations, files are shared using insecure methods such as email, messaging applications, or open cloud links, which lack proper access control, encryption, and monitoring. This leads to unauthorized access, data leakage, and absence of accountability.
This project proposes a Secure Role-Based File Sharing System that integrates strong authentication, role-based authorization, encrypted file storage, and audit logging. The system ensures that only authorized users can access specific files based on their roles, while all file activities are logged for security monitoring and accountability.

Problem Statement

Existing file sharing systems do not provide fine-grained role-based access control, secure encrypted storage, and comprehensive audit logging, resulting in unauthorized access, data breaches, and lack of traceability.

Objectives

To implement secure user authentication using JWT

To enforce role-based access control

To securely store files using encryption

To prevent unauthorized file access

To maintain detailed audit logs

To ensure data confidentiality and accountability

Existing System Drawbacks

Files shared through email, WhatsApp, or open links

No role-based access restrictions

Files stored without encryption

No tracking of file access

No accountability for misuse

Proposed System

The proposed system provides:

Secure JWT-based authentication

Role-based authorization (RBAC)

Encrypted file storage using AES

Controlled file access

Complete audit logging

System Roles
Admin

Workflow (Step-by-Step)

User logs in with credentials

System authenticates user

JWT token is generated

User sends requests with token

Role validation is performed

File is encrypted before storage

File is decrypted only after authorization

Every action is logged

Response is sent to user

System Architecture Explanation

Client sends request to Spring Boot server

Authentication module validates credentials

Authorization module checks user role

Encryption module secures files

File storage module saves encrypted files

Audit module logs all activities

Database stores user, file, and log data

Modules Description

Authentication Module – Handles login and JWT

Authorization Module – Enforces RBAC

File Management Module – Upload & download handling

Encryption Module – AES encryption & decryption

Audit Logging Module – Tracks all actions

Admin Module – User and access management
